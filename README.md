Tired of repetitive tasks? Yearning for the efficiency of an A.I. companion? Look no further! S.I.R.I  empowers you to automate daily routines with the power of voice commands.

## What can this A.I. assistant do for you?

* It can send emails to you.
* It can play music for you.
* It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
* It can open websites like Google, YouTube, etc., in a web browser.
